# view profile && book : 

lets just keep most of the gibberish there . the most importants are : 

1 > if the doctor is available today >> [
    just go through all the visitings of the doctor >> [we can create a selector for that ]
    * and then have that in the page and check if any of the slot's time is for today >> 
]
2 > all the coming slots for the doctor >> [so that patient can choose]
    and using that very selctor we just map the slots there >>
